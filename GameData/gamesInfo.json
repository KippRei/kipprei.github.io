    "summary": "Achilles: Legends Untold is an isometric action RPG that draws inspiration from soulslike and hack \u0026 slash genres. However, compared to them, the title by Polish studio Dark Point Games has a much lower level of entry. The creators wanted to make a game that would be more accessible to beginners, who are just starting their adventure with this type of gameplay. It doesn’t mean, however, that Achilles: Legends Untold is a title aimed only at newcomers, because it is filled with optional challenging missions, which will certainly also satisfy experienced players.",

GRIME is a fast and unforgiving Action-Adventure RPG in which you crush your foes with living weapons that mutate form and function, and then consume their remains with a black hole to strengthen your vessel as you break apart a world of anatomical horror and intrigue.\n\nAn unusual material collapses in on itself, the world shudders and contracts, and suddenly you are squeezed into existence.\n\nWhat awaits you is a world unknown, alien in its own familiarity, and you must survive what terrors you face. Explore your surreal surroundings, absorb the many enemies you encounter, and use their own traits against them as you let yourself become far more than you once were.\n\nGRIME lets you play to your preference, upgrading only those traits you feel most suited to your unique style. You’ll find there is more than one way to break open an enemy as you move through a variety of evocative environments, meet their inhabitants, and discover the source of their madness.\n\nUncover mysterious secrets in weeping caves and face-covered deserts. Meet otherworldly characters in distinct civilizations across an organic, interconnected world - all rendered in unearthly 3D. Face foes born of the world itself, and swallow them whole.",

The world of The Surge offers a very grim vision of the future, where the evolution of our technology, our society and our relation with the environment led to a decadent state of the Human civilization.\n\nFitted with an advanced CREO exo-suit, balancing your core power against your implants and exo-suit upgrades will allow you to specialize in a huge variety of combat styles, thanks to the almost limitless combinations of addons and dozens of make-shift weapons salvaged from the industrial complex. Finely tune your gear to match your playstyle, and to best suit the challenge ahead. The Metroidvanian levels open up as your core power increases, allowing you to over-charge doors previously too strong for your suit to damage and opening new pathways for you to explore. The CREO facility is vast, and if you want to find and craft the best equipment and weapons, you will need to search every area for secrets and hidden items.",

Robots gone haywire, insane augmented co-workers and rogue AI - everything wants you dead.\nDefy deadly enemies and huge bosses in tight, visceral melee combat. Target and slice specific limbs off your foes, with a next-gen loot system where you loot what you dismember. Equip, upgrade and craft new weapons and armors sliced from enemies, and make yourself stronger through a fresh take on leveling-up.",

One kingdom, however, found success in wielding the power of alchemy to produce antibodies. The kingdom used the antibodies to strengthen their soldiers by making them immune to disease and enhancing their natural abilities. It wasn’t before long that the kingdom became known as the most powerful in the world.\n\nDecades later, an attempt was made to try and neutralize the use of alchemy in the kingdom, but it had detrimental consequences and all the kingdoms’ soldiers mutated into horrifying monsters. The kingdom was in chaos and monsters roamed the kingdom destroying anything in their path.\n\nIt’s now up to Corvus to find out what happened, but he has lost his memory. The truth can only be pieced together from his memories which he’ll have to recover while trying to hack and slash his way through a world infested with monsters.",
