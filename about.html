        <p>From Wikipedia:</p>
        <p>"A Soulslike (also spelled Souls-like) is a subgenre of action role-playing games known
             for high levels of difficulty and emphasis on environmental storytelling, typically in a 
             dark fantasy setting. It had its origin in Demon's Souls and the Dark Souls series by FromSoftware,
              the themes and mechanics of which directly inspired several other games. Soulslike games developed by
               FromSoftware themselves have been specifically referred to as Soulsborne games, a portmanteau of
                Souls and Bloodborne. The "Soulslike" name has been adopted by a number of critics and developers.
                 However, there have also been questions whether it is a true genre or a collection of shared 
                 mechanics.</p>
            <p>While the description is typically applied to action role-playing games, the core concepts of high
             difficulty, repeated character death driving player knowledge and mastery of the game world, sparsity 
             of save points, and giving information to the player through indirect, environmental storytelling are
              sometimes seen in games in very different genres, the mechanics of which are sometimes described as 
              Soulslike."</p>
